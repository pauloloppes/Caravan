## Brief overview

This was my graduation project for my degree in System Analysis for Fatec Taubat√©. It's objective is to help manage a group of people going in bus trips the user is organizing.

It was developed using Java and integrating with Firebase to manage access and database (non-relational). The objective of creating a cohesive system which executes CRUD operations for the entities of the system was achieved with certain success, and was approved by the bench.

## Issues

When I started this project I had very little experience with development for Android. As I kept working on it I got to perceive non-optimal ways I was approaching tasks, some which would require major refactoring of a significant part of the project, refactoring that actually happened once or twice during development.
